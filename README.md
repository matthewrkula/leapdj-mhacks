leapdj-mhacks
=============
LeapDJ is an application that I created for the 2013 MHacks hackathon at the University of Michigan. 

Here is a demo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX94gtECMhw

So far it supports:
  - Controlling pitch and tempo using one hand with five fingers spread out.
  - Reversing the song when two hands are detected (move second hand in/out for "scratching" effect)
  - Playing extra audio with one spinning finger (siren.mp3 will play right now)

This project requires the LeapSDK and the Java Media Framework (JMF) for audio playback.
